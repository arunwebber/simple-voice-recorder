## Description

This web-based **Voice Recorder** application allows users to record their audio, view a live waveform, track the recording duration in real-time (including milliseconds), and download the recording once completed. The application provides a user-friendly interface for easy recording, pausing, and re-recording. The waveform is generated in real-time, giving a visual representation of the sound being captured.

## Features

- **Start/Stop Recording**: Record audio directly from your microphone.
- **Real-time Waveform**: Visualize the audio waveform as you record.
- **Recording Duration**: Track the recording time in seconds and milliseconds.
- **Playback & Download**: Listen to the recorded audio and download it as a `.wav` file.
- **Pause & Resume**: Pause and resume the recording at any time.
- **Re-record**: Start a new recording after finishing or pausing the current one.
